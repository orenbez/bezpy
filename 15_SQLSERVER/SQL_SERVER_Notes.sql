https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp
--SQL Server comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:
DATE -- format YYYY-MM-DD
DATETIME -- format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
SMALLDATETIME -- format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
TIMESTAMP -- format: a unique number

-- ADD COLUMN
ALTER TABLE [WangExport].[dbo].[FIVE_SIGMA_PAYMENT_NUMBER]
ADD tax_id_number char(9)

-- DROP COLUMN
ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN ContactName;

-- WARNING the default datatype is 'TEXT' which is a pain to work with and deprecated.  
-- FOR 'TEXT' need to use 'LIKE' instead of '=' in sql query

/* You need to do this in correct order due to dependencies */

CONVERT is more flexible in that you can format dates etc (see below). Other than that, they are pretty much the same.
