# If you want to create a WSGI web application then this is a good resource for you. It will provide various utilities
# for creating advanced WSGI applications. It includes lots of features like an interactive debugger that allows
# inspecting stack traces and source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any frame in the stack,
# a full-featured request object with objects to interact with headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies,
# a response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle streaming data, and many more.

# This is a screamingly fast, ultra-lightweight WSGI server for CPython 2 and CPython 3. It is written in C using Marc
# Lehmann’s high-performance libev event loop and Ryan Dahl’s http-parser. It includes features like single-threaded
# and without coroutines or other crap, Python 2 and Python 3 support, etc.
